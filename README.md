# BreakOff
A Break Out/Arkanoid clone. Built in Pygame. The premise of the game is about shooting down German zeppelins with a fireball.

This was my first time using Pygame. I followed a tutorial to build the functionality of the game, which can be found at http://codentronix.com/2011/04/14/game-programming-with-python-and-pygame-making-breakout/. I found Pygame quite simple to use. I'm sure it is a very versatile tool. Also I think I'm starting to get more into the habit of documenting my code.
